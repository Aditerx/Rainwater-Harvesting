            <h1>RAINWATER HARVESTING IN COMMERCIAL AREA</h1>
        </div>

        <!--Introduction-->

        <div class="com_intro">
            <p>We use water for various purposes like: drinking, irrigation, industry, transport and for the production of hydro-electricity. The scarcity of water is a well-known fact in the most urban areas where population is rapidly increasing. Today, much attention has been given to achieve a comprehensive solution to this problem and one such solution is <b>“Rainwater Harvesting”</b>.
                As the population grows, cities and suburbs expand with more buildings and so the demand for water continues to increase. The installation of a rainwater collection system is becoming increasingly important for businesses and commercial organizations. <b>Rainwater Harvesting</b> is the first solution in a water management strategy for commercial, public and residential buildings.
            </p>
            <img src="images/com_intro.jpg" id="com_intro">
            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">If you have a commercial property then you can save millions of gallons of drinking water each year with an eco-friendly approach known as <b>Rainwater Harvesting</b>. If you are looking for relevant information on <b>Rainwater Harvesting</b> then you are at the right place to get it. Rainwater collection system is a very cost-effective solution that brings great benefits to commercial buildings such as: office buildings, schools, hotels, resorts, hospitals, homes. goods, etc.</p>

        <!--Explaining methods in commercial area-->

        <div class="com_explain">
            <div class="com_explain_methods">
            <h1>Rainwater Harvesting: An effective solution for commercial users</h1>
            <p>Rainwater Harvesting systems are gradually becoming part of sustainable water management practices. Rainwater Harvesting is a process of collecting, storing and reusing rainwater. Rainwater Harvesting is one of the simplest ways for us to live sustainably with nature. Rainwater collection systems work by collecting rainwater from roof gutters, filtering it, and storing the water in a storage tank.

                Rainwater extraction is gaining popularity leading to ecological conservation. Most commercial buildings use a significant amount of water and energy in their daily operations. Rainwater collection is an old and effective technique of collecting rainwater during the rainy season for later use. The ecological benefit of a rainwater harvesting system for commercial buildings is that it will significantly reduce the amount of water used from the grid.
            </p>
            <p>To better understand the Rainwater Harvesting, lets have a look at its <b>methods</b>. Majorly, there are <b>two</b> Rainwater Harvesting methods and are as follows:</p>
            <p>1. <b>Surface Runoff Rainwater Harvesting</b></p>
            <p>2. <b>Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting</b></p>

            <!--Explaining surface runoff method-->

            <div class="com_sur_explain">
                <h2>Surface Runoff Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
                <p>Rainwater Harvesting using ground or land surface catchment areas is less complex way of collecting rainwater. This technique is mainly suitable for storing water for agricultural purposes.</p>
                <img src="images/com_sur_explain1.jpg" id="com_sur_explain1">
                
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><b>Surface Runoff Rainwater Harvesting</b> is a method of collecting rainwater flowing along the ground during the rains will be collected to a tank below the surface of the ground for irrigation and other purposes. During storage of rainwater, it is important to incorporate efficient and effective water conservation methods i.e. by reducing evaporation. It is a very easy to adopt technology and very profitable if used accordingly. The main objective of surface runoff rainwater harvesting method is to meet the ever increasing demand of water, to reduce water pollution, soil erosion and flooding of roads.</p>

            <!--Explaining rooftop method-->

            <div class="com_roof_explain">
                <h2>Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
                <img src="images/com_sur_explain3.jpg" id="com_sur_explain3">
                <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><b>Roof Top Rainwater Harvesting</b> is a method of collecting rain water where it falls and in which rain water is captured from the roof catchments of domestic houses or commercial buildings and stored in the tanks. Harvested rain water can either be stored in a tank or diverted to artificial recharge system to meet the household/commercial needs through storage in tanks. This method is simple, eco-friendly, less expensive and truly effective. Roof-top rainwater harvesting method (RRH) involves diverting and recharging (or) storing rainwater that falls on the roof of a house/building. The main objective of rooftop rain water harvesting is to make water available for future use, to improve quality of ground water and etc.</p>
