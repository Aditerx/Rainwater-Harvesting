Below you will find the resources to educate yourself on the best method for harvesting rainwater in your situation. You will also find information about the basic components of a rainwater collection system. Even though rainwater catchment is an old technology, there have been many improvements over time through product innovations. <br><br>
                        The only thing that differs in the following methods is the scale of the system. They all follow the same principles but differ on aesthetics and actual water conservation effectiveness. <br><br>

                        Rainwater harvesting as a primary water supply is a relatively new idea and industry. Therefore, the laws around rainwater harvesting can be a concern. As of right now, the federal government does not regulate rainwater harvesting at all, but rather, leaves it up to the individual state governments. Make sure that your rainwater harvesting trade contractor is aware of and complies with local codes and regulations. <br><br>
                        In almost every case, it is not illegal to harvest rainwater. Rainwater is a resource, and once it falls on your property, it<span>&#39;</span>s yours. <br><br>

                    <h1 class="title_text">A Successful System</h1>
                    <p>
                        The basic principles of rainwater harvesting are rather simple, catch rainwater, store it, use it. But there are components, details, and processes that are critical to the success of a rainwater harvesting system. <br><br>
                        What do we mean by a successful system? <br><br>
                        Rainwater harvesting as your main water supply should only bring benefits and improvement to your water, this includes: <br><br>
                        <b>Water quality: </b>Based on purpose, the water should be clear, odorless, and taste great and needs to be bacteria-free through the use of a water disinfection system such as ultraviolet light or just simply clean, no dust, dirt, insects or any organic matter for non<span>&minus;</span>potable uses. <br><br>
                        <b>Water pressure: </b>The water should flow at the highest pressure possible without exceeding proper limits. <br><br>
                        <b>Water storage: </b>The water being stored should be odor-free, slime-free, and clear. <br><br>
                        <b>System design: </b>The system should be designed to meet the supply and demand of the home and its occupants. What is the sq. ft. roof surface that will be collecting rainwater? What is the average annual/monthly rainfall in the area? How much storage gives enough buffer to supply the house with ease, even with rain lapses? <br><br>
                        These are 4 points that help in determining a successful rainwater harvesting system, but more aspects are involved even beyond these. <br><br>

                    <p>
                        Before learning how to create a complete rainwater collection system, we need to learn about all available harvesting methods: <br><br>

                <!-- Explaining Rainwater Barrels method -->
                <div>
                    <div class="container col-sm_5">
                        <p>
                            <b>1. Rainwater Barrels: </b>Barrel installation is the cheapest and easiest way to start harvesting rainwater in your home. A barrel is simply installed underneath the downspout of the guttering so that rain falling on the roof is funneled into the barrel. <br><br>
                            Usually, the container will consist of a spigot under it to enable you to draw water and irrigate your garden. Better still, a hose can be connected to the spigot or to a drip irrigation system. <br><br>
                            Barrels are advantageous because they can effortlessly be sourced whether recycled or new. If you opt for the recycled barrel, make a point to know exactly what the barrel was used for in order to be sure that no chemical residues remain inside. If you reside in a mosquito-infested area, make sure to include a lid for your barrel to mitigate the possibility of mosquitoes breeding in your barrel. <br><br>
                            When winter month knocks, it is advisable to disconnect your barrel to prevent freezing and cracking. The major disadvantage of rainwater barrels is that they have a limited capacity; meaning prolonged rains would result in flooding. The barrels are easy to use and readily available for purchase at many locations, all at reasonable prices. <br><br>
                        </p>

                            <b>2. Dry System: </b>This is a well-known method of rainwater harvesting. It<span>&#39;</span>s basically an improvement to the rainwater barrel technique in terms of size. A larger water storage container is situated just a few steps from the property. This container provides a much larger storage capacity compared to the barrel. <br><br>
                            The gutter is then diverted to channel water into the tank. It<span>&#39;</span>s also easy to implement and relatively cheap. The name “dry” comes from the fact that the collection pipe dries up after any rainy day because it<span>&#39;</span>s meant to empty into the top of the tank. The dry system is ideal for areas with huge storms. <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>3. Wet System: </b>The wet system is the exact opposite of the dry system. This is because the collection pipes are ever full of water since they are located underground. Here, numerous collection pipes are connected to multiple downspouts on the building and channeled to empty into the storage tank underground. <br><br>                        </p>

                        <p>When there is no rain, the level stays constant, and the pipes are always full. Due to the ever availability of water inside the pipes, it is recommended that they be watertight to mitigate the possibility of leaking into the soil. The underground piping makes it relatively expensive to install compared to the dry and wet systems. <br><br></p>

                            <b>4. Green Roof: </b>This method of rainwater harvesting literally cuts out the middleman. Instead of directing rainwater for storage in the tank and then channel it to the garden; you could install a green roof on your house to enable plants to use the water instantly. But you have to lay down a lining for your roof<span>&#39;</span>s protection and include a drainage system to take care of the runoffs. <br><br>
                            Installing garden beds with plants that require low maintenance is the surefire way of maximizing your plot<span>&#39;</span>s productive space and leveraging the rainwater where it falls. Also, installing a green roof will add insulation to your house and cushion your roof from damage. <br><br>
                            If you prefer you can create your own barrels for rainwater harvesting. Just a few components like the Catchment area, conveyance system, first rain separator, filter unit, storage, delivery system, usage, recharge, and supplies are needed to create your own barrel. <br><br>
                            You will need to follow the instructions included with your rainwater harvesting kit to set things up and begin the collection of the rainwater. For a DIY job, there are many resources available to you on the internet at no charge. You can definitely take advantage of the information whenever you need to and create your own rainwater harvesting system. <br><br>

                            <b>5. Retention Ponds: </b>Retention ponds are used to collect surface runoff water and improve the quality of water by natural processes like sedimentation, decomposition, solar disinfection, and soil filtration. This type of pond normally has a mud bottom, but in some cases, it may be lined with concrete. The most common use of water collected and harvested by pond harvesting is watering livestock, however, it can also be used for groundwater recharge, irrigation or any other purpose other than potable uses. <br><br>
                            These can be costly, unsightly, and use a significant amount of space. Retention ponds are a cost-only method of stormwater retention and provide little in gain, including the unfortunate migration of more mosquitoes into the area. There are retention ponds that have been made to add a pleasant view to the property, but to do this costs even more. Most developers try to hide retention ponds the best they can. <br><br>

                            <b>6. Permeable Pavers: </b>A Permeable Pavement stormwater runoff system stores water by allowing stormwater runoff to infiltrate through porous surfaces into a storage reservoir. This method of stormwater runoff harvesting utilizes a free resource to reduce municipal water supply costs, while complying with regional stormwater management guidelines. <br><br>
                            In southern climates, a NO INFILTRATION system (complete with liner) can be used as the long term storage reservoir, with the water being used for irrigation, washing or other non-potable applications. An integrated control system, is typically used to operate these harvesting systems. In addition, where the system is also serving a stormwater management function, it is recommended that an active control system be used to monitor weather forecast information and to automatically draw down the water volume to accommodate projected precipitation rates. <br><br>
                            This can be a very costly way of retaining stormwater. And again, it is a cost-only method that can provide little benefit other than the retention itself. Permeable pavers can be made to be a beautiful addition to the landscape of a property. This, of course, comes with a price. <br><br>
